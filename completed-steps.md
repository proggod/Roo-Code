# Completed Steps: Integrating roo_cursor Improvements

## Step 1: Resolved Merge Conflicts

1. ✅ Accepted the modular structure in `src/core/Cline.ts`
2. ✅ Fixed merge conflict in `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`
3. ✅ Updated `WebviewMessage.ts` to add "checkpointDiff" message type

## Step 2: Implemented Core Improvements

1. ✅ Created `src/integrations/diff-approve/` directory
2. ✅ Added `DiffApproveProvider.ts` implementation from roo_cursor branch
3. ✅ Created `util.ts` with the required `getNonce` function
4. ✅ Added import for DiffApproveProvider in Cline.ts
5. ✅ Replaced `checkpointDiff` method with the enhanced version
6. ✅ Updated `checkpointSave` method to be async
7. ✅ Added new `getVerifiedCheckpoint` method
8. ✅ Added `escapeRegExp` helper function

## Step 3: Updated OS Context Handling

1. ✅ Updated `parseMentions` function to accept an `osInfo` parameter
2. ✅ Updated calls to `parseMentions` in Cline's `initiateTaskLoop` method to include OS info

## Step 4: Enhanced Tool Implementations

1. ✅ Updated `attemptCompletionTool.ts` to add auto-open diff viewer functionality

## Step 5: Added Required Media Files

1. ✅ Created media directory
2. ✅ Added `diffApprove.css` and `diffApprove.js` files from roo_cursor branch

## Next Steps

1. Implement the WebView components for the checkpoint diff feature
2. Test the functionality thoroughly to ensure all improvements work correctly
3. Consider adding thorough documentation for the new features

The integration has successfully preserved:

- The modular architecture from the main branch
- The improved checkpoint and diff functionality from roo_cursor branch
- OS-specific context handling improvements
- The auto-open diff viewer functionality
- The visualization of diffs through the DiffApproveProvider

All of these improvements have been successfully integrated while maintaining the clean, modular structure of the main branch.
